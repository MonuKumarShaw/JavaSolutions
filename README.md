   - Binary Tree (Basic construction and traversal)

2. **Sorting Algorithms:**
   - Bubble Sort
   - Selection Sort
   - Insertion Sort
   - Counting Sort
   - Inbuilt Arrays.sort() and Collections.sort()

3. **Other Logic-Based Programs:**
   - Various utility methods and logic-based implementations to support the above data structures.

## âœ… Purpose:
- This set of code files represents my hands-on experience and comfort with Java.
- I regularly use Java for problem-solving and DSA practice.
- This submission showcases my understanding of algorithms, logic building, and how data structures work internally.

## ðŸ§  Usage:
- All files are standalone and can be run independently.
- Java version used: `Java 8+`
